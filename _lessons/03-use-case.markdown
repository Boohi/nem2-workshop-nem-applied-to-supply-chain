A producer of perishable goods has a process to check if the products are safe for consumption.

Once the factory produces a good, it is stored in a warehouse. At this moment, an operator registers the product in the company's system. 

The same person, or another operator, perform some tests to determine whether the product is safe for consumption or not. The results obtained are stored in a database.

## Finding the value proposition - Why?

Which is the exact value proposition to use blockchain in this use case?

Traceability and transparency are vital in logistics. Perishable products are tracked through all the supply chain to decide if the goods can be sold to the consumers.

We will use blockchain to:

a) Identify each product uniquely. 

b) Keep track of the state of the product.

c) Ensure the product follows certain conditions and procedures.

d) Certify that only allowed actors can execute specific processes.
