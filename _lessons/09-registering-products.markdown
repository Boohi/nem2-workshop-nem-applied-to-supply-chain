Open the [dasbhoard](http://localhost:4200). The warehouse operator uses it to register products and send safety seals. However, the integration with NEM blockchain technology is not 100% done. Step by step, you will have to complete the code to make the use case work.


## Create a new product

Registering a product consists of:

1) Create a new product in the existent SQL database.

2) Create a new blockchain account.

3) Send an initial transaction to the account.

Under ``Create Product`` tab, click twice "Create New Product" button.

    ℹ️ The server, the dashboard and the catapult bootstrap service must be running.

When clicking the button, you are executing a POST call to the company's server. The company's server is responsible for creating a new product and saving it it in the database.

Open the file with your favourite text editor ``project/server/src/controller/product/product.controller.ts``.

{% highlight typescript %}
export let createProduct: ExpressSignature = (request, response, next) => {
    const productService = new ProductService();

    // Save product in the database and return product created
    return productService.createProduct()
        .subscribe(product => response.status(200).send(product.toMessage()),
            err => response.status(400).send(err));
};
{% endhighlight %}

The public key you are seeing is generated directly in the dashboard, applying the sha256 cryptographic hash algorithm to ('company' +  product ID), this latest ID generated by the MySQL database. 

## Is the product in the blockchain? 

Click the product number. The product information screen shows the state of a product. As you can see, NEM blockchain does not know anything about this product.

The product will be stored on the blockchain with the first issued transaction. You must add a function that registers the product in the blockchain.

 Open ``project/server/.env``, and add the company's private key.

{% highlight bash %}

COMPANY_PRIVATE_KEY='B...3'

{% endhighlight %}

Modify ``createProduct`` function. After saving the product in the database, send the first transaction to the product to timestamp its creation's date and owner.

{% highlight typescript %}
export let createProduct: ExpressSignature = (request, response, next) => {

    const productService = new ProductService();

    const companyPrivateKey = process.env.COMPANY_PRIVATE_KEY as string;
    const companyAccount = Account
        .createFromPrivateKey(companyPrivateKey, NetworkType.MIJIN_TEST);

    // Save product in the database and return product created
    return productService.createProduct()
        .pipe(
            mergeMap(product => {
                return productService.registerProductInBlockchain(companyAccount, product.id).pipe(
                    map(ignored => product)
                )
            })
        )
        .subscribe(product => response.status(200).send(product.toMessage()),
            err => response.status(400).send(err));
};
{% endhighlight %}

Open ``project/server/src/domain/product/product.service.ts`` and complete ``registerProductBlockchain`` function.

{% highlight typescript %}
    public registerProductInBlockchain(account: Account, productId: number) : Observable<TransactionAnnounceResponse>{

        // Create deterministic public key for product
        const product = Asset.create(account.publicAccount,
            'company',
            productId.toString(),
            {});

        // Create transaction
        const publishableProduct = AssetService.publish(product);

        // Sign transfer transaction with company account
        const signedTransaction = account.sign(publishableProduct);

        return this.transactionHttp.announce(signedTransaction);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

We are generating the first transaction using the third party library [nem2-asset-identifier](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/nem2-asset-identifier).

    ℹ️  This library helps us to identify assets in nem blockchain, by creating the public key in a deterministic way and preparing the first transaction setting an owner. It also provides a set of standards to read and write in accounts that represent assets.

Once the transaction is created and signed with the company's account, it can be announced to the network.

Restart the server to apply the changes.

Create a new product, and wait a few seconds until the transaction gets confirmed. Click on the product's number. Under **Last 10 transactions**, see the product registered in the blockchain.
