## What?

NEM is a **flexible blockchain** technology.  Instead of uploading all the application logic into the blockchain, you can use it's tested features through API calls for:

* Transfer and storage of value.
* Authorisation.
* Traceability.
* Authentication.

The rest of the code remains **off-chain**. This reduces the inherent **immutability risk**, as you could change the process when necessary. Imagine receiving feedback from the users, or the necessity to add a new unexpected functionality.

We will start with a very basic  **minimum viable product**. Then, as the workshop continues, we will be adding some more complexity.

1) As a warehouse operator, I want to register a product.

2) As a warehouse operator, I want to register if a product is safe for consumption.
