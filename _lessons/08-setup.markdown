The creation of the company's, warehouse operator's account and registration of the mosaic are **actions that are performed once**. For this kind of tasks, we normally use the **NEM2-CLI**.

## Creating warehouse operator's account

1\. Open a terminal, and generate a new account.

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli account generate
Introduce network type (MIJIN_TEST, MIJIN, MAIN_NET, TEST_NET): MIJIN_TEST
Do you want to save it? [y/n]: y
Introduce NEM 2 Node URL. (Example: http://localhost:3000): http://localhost:3000
Insert profile name (blank means default and it could overwrite the previous profile): operator
{% endhighlight %}

2\. Get the warehouse operator's account's key pair and address.

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli profile list
{% endhighlight %}


## Creating company's account

Performing actions in the blockchain have a cost. This is necessary to provide an incentive for those who validate and secure the network. The fee is paid in **XEM**, the underlying cryptocurrency of the NEM network.

    ℹ️ In a private network, you could set transaction fees to 0.

Instead of creating a new account, let's use an account which already has XEM. We will need it to register the namespace and mosaic.

1\. Open a terminal. Then go to the directory where you have download Catapult Bootstrap Service.

{% highlight bash %}

$> cd  build/generated-addresses/
$> cat addresses.yaml

{% endhighlight %}

Under the section ``nemesis_addresses``, you will find the key pairs which contain XEM.


2\. Load the first account as a profile in NEM2-CLI. This account identifies the company.

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli profile create

Introduce network type (MIJIN_TEST, MIJIN, MAIN_NET, TEST_NET): MIJIN_TEST
Introduce your private key: 41************************************************************FF
Introduce NEM 2 Node URL. (Example: http://localhost:3000): http://localhost:3000
Insert profile name (blank means default and it could overwrite the previous profile): company

{% endhighlight %}

##  Register company's namespace 

The company registers the namespace by announcing a [RegisterNamespaceTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/guides/namespace/registering-a-namespace.html). Once announced the transaction, the server will return an OK response.

**Receiving an OK response doesn’t mean the transaction is valid, hence is is still not included in a block.** A good practice is to monitor transactions before announcing them.

1\. Open two new terminals. The first terminal monitors announced transactions **validation errors**.

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli monitor status --profile company
{% endhighlight %}

Once a transaction is included in a block, you will see it under the **confirmed** terminal.

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli monitor confirmed --profile company
{% endhighlight %}

2\. Register the namespace ``company``, setting a lease duration expressed in blocks.

    ℹ️ By default blocks complete every 15 seconds on average. 90000 blocks are 15,62 days approximately. 

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli transaction namespace --name company --rootnamespace --duration 90000 --profile company
{% endhighlight %}

3\. Did the network confirm the transaction? Check the opened terminals.

##  Register company.safety subnamespace

Once the company's namespace has been registered, you can create related subnamespaces.

Register the subnamespace ``company.safety``:

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli  transaction namespace --name safety --subnamespace  --parentname company --profile company
{% endhighlight %}

## Create company.safety:seal mosaic

The mosaic name is ``seal`` and the parent namespace ``company.safety``.  Create it with a total ``supply`` of 1.000.000.

Define this mosaic as ``transferable``, with ``divisibility`` 0 (without decimals) and with ``lease duration`` of 90000 blocks. ``supply mutable`` option allows you to increase or decrease the amount of this type of mosaics in the future.

    ℹ️ XEM has divisibility 6. 1.000 in absolute amount is written 1000000000. 

1\. Create the mosaic.

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli transaction mosaic --mosaicname seal --namespacename company.safety --amount 1000000 --transferable --supplymutable --divisibility 0 --duration 90000 --profile company
{% endhighlight %}

2\. Transfer 1.000 company.safety:seal and 1.000 XEM to operator's account.

{% highlight bash %}
$> nem2-cli transaction transfer --profile company
Introduce the recipient address: SA56XXRVS7NG7UH3DTZEMRIVJJLDXXPKAYQAFT2S
Introduce the mosaics in the format namespaceName:mosaicName::absoluteAmount, add multiple mosaics splitting them with a comma:
> company.safety:seal::1000,nem:xem::1000000000

{% endhighlight %}
